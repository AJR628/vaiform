# Vaiform Cohesion Hardening Plan (Living SSOT)

> This file is the **single living plan** for repo cohesion.  
> It is intentionally ‚Äúbroad but detailed‚Äù so we don‚Äôt drift while hardening + adding features.

**North Star:** make the repo easy to understand, secure by default, and stable enough for 100s ‚Üí 1000s of users.

**Canonical API Contract (must not drift):**

- Success: `{ success: true, data, requestId }`
- Failure: `{ success: false, error, detail, fields?, requestId }`
- `fields` must be `{ "<path>": "<single string message>" }` (no arrays, no zod raw objects)

**Flags posture (secure-by-default):**

- `ENABLE_LEGACY_ROUTES=0` (default) ‚Üí legacy/orphan mounts are unreachable
- `VAIFORM_DEBUG=0` (default) ‚Üí diag endpoints are unreachable

**As-of:** 2026-02-18

## Status Ledger (what‚Äôs set vs what‚Äôs left)

### ‚úÖ Completed / Locked In

- **Docs hygiene:** historical audits/plans archived under `docs/_archive/**/2026-02-16/`, with `docs/_archive/INDEX.md`.
- **Legacy caption contract:** `docs/caption-meta-contract.md` is a stub linking to the archived legacy contract + pointing to the V3 contract doc.
- **Prettier stability:** `.prettierignore` excludes archives + build output so CI isn‚Äôt blocked by old artifacts.
- **Truth-docs front door:** `README.md` links only to SSOT docs.
- **C1** Baseline truth snapshot (docs) ‚Äî in place and aligned to repo reality.
- **C2** Cohesion guardrails spec ‚Äî SSOT ownership + anti-duplication rules exist.
- **C3** CI changed-files contract gate ‚Äî blocks _new_ drift without forcing full-repo cleanup.
- **C4** Story spine contract pass ‚Äî Zod validation `fields` normalized to `{path: string}` in `src/routes/story.routes.js`.
- **C5** Assets contract pass ‚Äî disabled AI images route + controller now use canonical disabled behavior and contain no legacy response payload keys.
- **C6** Post-spine truth refresh ‚Äî `ACTIVE_SURFACES`, `VAIFORM_REPO_COHESION_AUDIT`, and `ROUTE_TRUTH_TABLE` reconciled with current runtime truth.
- **Green-path caller hardening:** `/creative` is canonical caller surface; static ordering fixed to `dist -> public -> SPA fallback`.
- **Lint posture hardening:** `lint` scoped to green-path server surfaces; `lint:full` retained for broader cleanup.

### üü° In Progress / Partial (implemented but not fully conforming)

- **C7** App-entry contract cleanup is in progress: `src/app.js` envelope pass is done; `src/handlers/credits.get.js` remains.

### üî¥ Not Started (still planned work)

- **C8-C9** Active contract passes for remaining controllers/routes
- **C10‚ÄìC12** SSOT consolidation (auth/plan guards/validation/idempotency duplicate removal)
- **C13‚ÄìC15** Canonical `/api` router + remove duplicate mounts + credits dedupe
- **C16‚ÄìC17** Launch posture verification + final cohesion publication

### Current Priority (next few commits)

1. **Finish C7 app-entry cleanup** (`src/handlers/credits.get.js` envelope conformance)
2. **Continue C8/C9 active contract passes** (controllers/routes still returning legacy envelopes)
3. **Begin C10‚ÄìC12 SSOT dedupe** (auth/plan guards/validation/idempotency)

---

## Public API / Interface Changes (contract + invariants)

1. Canonical success: `{ success: true, data, requestId }`.
2. Canonical failure: `{ success: false, error, detail, fields?, requestId }`.
3. `/api/assets/ai-images` (while disabled): canonical `410 FEATURE_DISABLED` **including requestId**.
4. Story finalize idempotency guarantee: replay response shape matches fresh success shape **exactly** (only `requestId` value may differ).

---

## Commit-by-Commit Plan (with status)

> **Rule:** One commit = one cohesion goal. Avoid mixing ‚Äúformat the world‚Äù with behavior changes unless the goal is formatting.

### C0 ‚Äî Repo Hygiene (Docs archive + Prettierignore) _(pre-plan but now SSOT)_

**Status:** ‚úÖ DONE  
**Scope:** `docs/_archive/**`, stub `docs/caption-meta-contract.md`, `.prettierignore`, `docs/_archive/INDEX.md`  
**Gate:** `npm run format:check` passes without touching archives

---

### C1 ‚Äî Baseline Truth Snapshot (Docs Only) _(legacy ref: 0.1)_

**Status:** ‚úÖ DONE

1. Scope: `VAIFORM_REPO_COHESION_AUDIT.md`, `ROUTE_TRUTH_TABLE.md`, `docs/ACTIVE_SURFACES.md`.
2. Update as-of reality for mounts, gating, CI coverage, and response drift.
3. Out of scope: runtime code.
4. Gate: every claim directly matches current code.

---

### C2 ‚Äî Cohesion Guardrails Spec (Docs Only) _(legacy ref: 0.2)_

**Status:** ‚úÖ DONE

1. Scope: `docs/COHESION_GUARDRAILS.md`.
2. SSOT ownership table (canonical vs deprecated) for auth, plan guards, idempotency, validation, routing, response helpers.
3. Include anti-duplication policy + middleware order.
4. Gate: decision-complete ownership map.

---

### C3 ‚Äî CI Contract Gate (Changed Files Only) _(legacy ref: 1.1)_

**Status:** ‚úÖ DONE

1. Scope: `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, `scripts/check-responses-changed.mjs` and wiring.
2. Required-now CI checks:
   - `npm run format:check`
   - `npm run test:security`
   - `npm run check:responses:changed`
3. Scan only changed `src/**/*.js` and `src/**/*.mjs` files in PR diff.
4. Disallowed response keys: `ok`, `reason`, `code`, `message`, `issues`.
5. Gate: CI blocks new drift in touched files without blocking on legacy debt.
6. Ratchet note: next required gate = active-surface; final = full repo-wide.

---

### C4 ‚Äî Story Spine Contract Pass (Routes + Required Middleware) _(legacy ref: 2.4c)_

**Status:** ‚úÖ DONE

1. Scope: `src/routes/story.routes.js`, `src/middleware/idempotency.firestore.js`, `src/middleware/planGuards.js` (envelope/output only).
2. Objective: all `/api/story/*` reachable responses use canonical envelope + `requestId`.
3. Preserve status codes and business logic.
4. Parity invariant:
   - Fresh finalize success and idempotency replay success must have identical JSON shape/keys (`success`, `data`, `shortId`, `requestId`), except `requestId` value.
5. Completed: Zod safeParse failures are normalized to `fields: {path: string}`.
6. Out of scope: mount topology, entitlements, SSOT refactors.
7. Gate: touched-file contract scan clean; 401/400/200 story responses contract-compliant.

---

### C5 ‚Äî Assets Contract Pass _(legacy ref: 2.4d)_

**Status:** ‚úÖ DONE

1. Scope: `src/routes/assets.routes.js`, `src/controllers/assets.controller.js`.
2. `/api/assets/options`: canonical envelopes only.
3. `/api/assets/ai-images` while disabled:
   - Keep `requireAuth`.
   - Remove `planGuard('pro')` and request validation from this disabled route.
   - Return canonical `410 FEATURE_DISABLED` **with requestId** directly (or via `fail`).
4. Completed cleanup:
   - Deleted unreachable legacy response blocks in `src/controllers/assets.controller.js` tied to disabled AI generation.
5. Out of scope: re-enabling AI image generation.
6. Gate: assets files contain no legacy response payload shapes.

---

### C6 ‚Äî Post-Spine Truth Refresh (Docs Only) _(legacy ref: 2.4e)_

**Status:** ‚úÖ DONE

1. Scope: `docs/ACTIVE_SURFACES.md`, `VAIFORM_REPO_COHESION_AUDIT.md`, `ROUTE_TRUTH_TABLE.md`.
2. Completed: captured post-story/assets contract status and caller-backed `/creative` truth.
3. Gate achieved: docs match code 1:1 for current active-surface and route-truth baseline.

---

### C7 ó App Entry Contract Cleanup _(legacy ref: 1.2)_

**Status:** IN PROGRESS

1. Scope: src/app.js, src/handlers/credits.get.js.
2. Completed in src/app.js: canonicalized /health, debug /diag/echo, and GET /generate guard envelopes.
3. Remaining: canonicalize src/handlers/credits.get.js while preserving current status semantics.
4. Gate: touched-file contract scan clean; behavior unchanged.
5. Scope note: /api/health parity may remain for later continuation if src/routes/health.routes.js is untouched in this phase.

---

---

## SSOT Dedupe Constraint (Explicit)

For `C10`‚Äì`C12`: **no behavioral changes**.  
Allowed: import rewiring, canonical module selection, dead duplicate removal, envelope normalization where already required.  
Not allowed: changing guard conditions, entitlements, or route behavior.

---

## Test Cases and Scenarios (must remain true)

1. Story endpoint 401 unauth returns canonical failure + `requestId`.
2. Story validation failure returns canonical `VALIDATION_FAILED` + `fields` + `requestId`.
3. Story success returns canonical success + `requestId`.
4. Story finalize replay vs fresh success response keys are identical.
5. Assets options returns canonical responses.
6. Disabled ai-images always returns canonical `410 FEATURE_DISABLED` + `requestId`.
7. CI fails when changed `src` files introduce disallowed response keys.
8. Default launch flags keep legacy routes unavailable while active routes remain functional.
9. Post-topology phase: no duplicate API mount ambiguity.

---

## Assumptions and Defaults

1. Launch scope stays Active-only.
2. Caption preview remains active (ungated by legacy flag).
3. CI ratchet starts with changed-files-only by design.
4. Active-surface and full repo-wide contract checks are phased in later.
5. This plan introduces no code changes by itself.
