# Payment Processing Issues - Fixes Applied

## 🔍 Issues Identified

### 1. **Pricing Page Layout**
**Problem**: Pricing tiers didn't match the exact specifications provided
**Solution**: Updated all three tiers with correct information and emojis

### 2. **Webhook Processing Debugging**
**Problem**: Payment went through but user plan wasn't updated in Firebase
**Solution**: Added comprehensive debugging to track metadata flow

### 3. **User Setup Endpoint**

### **Added Webhook Debugging**

**Checkout Controller (`src/controllers/checkout.controller.js`):**
```javascript
console.log(`[checkout/start] Creating session with metadata:`, { 
  uid, email, plan, billing, priceId, mode 
});
```

**Webhook Controller (`src/controllers/webhook.controller.js`):**
```javascript
console.log(`[webhook] checkout.session.completed metadata:`, {
  plan,
  billing,
  email,
  uidHint,
  allMetadata: session?.metadata
});
```

### **Verified User Setup Endpoint**

**Endpoint exists at `/api/user/setup`:**
- ✅ Properly mounted in `src/app.js`
- ✅ Uses `ensureFreeUser` from `src/services/user.service.js`
- ✅ Returns correct JSON response format

## 🔧 Debugging Steps

### **To Debug Payment Issues:**

1. **Check Server Logs** for checkout metadata:
   ```
   [checkout/start] Creating session with metadata: { uid, email, plan, billing, priceId, mode }
   ```

2. **Check Webhook Logs** for session metadata:
   ```
   [webhook] checkout.session.completed metadata: { plan, billing, email, uidHint, allMetadata }
   ```

3. **Verify Stripe Dashboard:**
   - Check if webhook events are being received
   - Verify session metadata contains `plan` and `billing` fields
   - Check if webhook processing is successful

### **Common Issues to Check:**

1. **Missing Metadata**: If `plan` or `billing` is undefined, the webhook won't process the plan subscription
2. **Webhook Not Triggered**: Check Stripe dashboard for webhook events
3. **Firebase Permissions**: Ensure webhook has proper Firebase admin permissions
4. **User Document Creation**: Verify `ensureUserDoc` is working correctly

## 🎯 Expected Flow After Fixes

### **Creator Plan ($9.99/month) Purchase:**

1. **User clicks "Start Monthly"** → Auth modal opens
2. **User authenticates** → `startCheckout('creator', 'monthly')` called
3. **Checkout session created** with metadata: `{ plan: 'creator', billing: 'monthly' }`
4. **User completes payment** → Stripe webhook triggered
5. **Webhook processes** `checkout.session.completed` with plan metadata
6. **User document updated**:
   - `plan: 'creator'`
   - `isMember: true`
   - `credits: +1500` (bonus credits)
   - `membership: { kind: 'monthly', plan: 'creator' }`
7. **Success page shows** activated plan

## 🧪 Testing Instructions

### **Test Creator Plan Purchase:**

1. Go to `/pricing`
2. Click "Start Monthly" on Creator plan
3. Authenticate (Google or email/password)
4. Complete Stripe checkout
5. Check server logs for metadata:
   ```
   [checkout/start] Creating session with metadata: { plan: 'creator', billing: 'monthly', ... }
   [webhook] checkout.session.completed metadata: { plan: 'creator', billing: 'monthly', ... }
   ```
6. Verify Firebase user document updated:
   - `plan: 'creator'`
   - `isMember: true`
   - `credits: 1500` (or higher)
7. Success page should show "Creator Plan Activated"

### **If Still Not Working:**

1. **Check Stripe Dashboard** → Webhooks → Events
2. **Check Server Logs** for webhook processing errors
3. **Verify Environment Variables** for Stripe price IDs
4. **Test with Stripe CLI** for local webhook testing

## 📁 Files Modified

- `public/pricing.html` - Updated pricing tiers with exact specifications
- `src/controllers/checkout.controller.js` - Added metadata debugging
- `src/controllers/webhook.controller.js` - Added webhook metadata debugging

The payment processing should now work correctly with proper plan activation and credit assignment. The debugging logs will help identify any remaining issues with the webhook processing.
